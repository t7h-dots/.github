## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This organization will hold all of my personal dotfiles.
Over the coming months, I want to do several things with this space:
 - A good, simple, sharable NixOS configuration
 - My own version of the [caelestia shell](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/shell)
 - My own version of the [caelestia cli](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/cli)
 - And hopefully more

My focus here is reproducability and ease of use, which is why I want to provide the whole thing as a NixOS configuration, but individual parts like the shell should also be easily usable on any system of your choosing.
